    "\n",
    "The Python code (run under TensorFlow 2.3) that was used to train and evaluate the LSTM1 model submitted to Interspeech 2021 is given below. The code is unaltered, except that (1) comments have been added, and (2) code used solely to evaluate the trained model on non-TIMIT data has been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code makes some assumptions based on the circumstances of our computational setup at the time (e.g. file names and locations, etc.) and so cannot be run as-is without the same setup. You may also notice differences in code between the four models. Some of these differences are due to the necessary differences between the 4 experiments, of course, while other differences are irrelevant to the training and evaluation, and are simply due to the evolution of the code over time, e.g. to make the code more readable and generalizable. An updated, generalized, and user-friendly version of the code for general public use has been provided in the **../User/** directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution:\n",
    "This script was run with two command-line parameters that indicate the number of formants and antiformants, and the output (consisting of data statistics, model specifications, and script progress reports, including training and validation loss) is saved to an output file, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM1.py 6 1 > LSTM1.f6z1.out\n",
    "\n",
    "It needs to be run on a server with access to Tensorflow 2.3. On a GPU, the script make take a few hours; on a CPU, the script may take several hours to a few days to run. (In our case, running the script on CPU machines using 24 parallel cores per job, these experiments ran between half a day and 2 days.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "If the name of the directory in which the script is run is e.g. expdir/, then the script looks for the input data in a sister directory ../data/, where the two input file lists timit_ordered1.txt and VTRlist0.txt (described below) should be found. Also in there should be a directory ../data/timit/srcflt_r480_ENV_db68/vtspecs/, which holds the individual spectral envelope files derived from each TIMIT wavefile (also described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "The output models and evaluation files are saved to a directory named expdir/mvt13_f6z1/ (where \"mvt13\" was the unique designation for this experiment, and \"f6z1\" indicates 6 formants and 1 zero). The model files are stored directly in this directory. A subdirectory, expdir/mvt13_f6z1/timit/, will hold the output formant track files, one for each input file. These are stored in a format (described below) that was designed for the specific interests of our laboratory, so scripts are provided that were used to extract the frequencies for evaluation against the VTR-TIMIT database."

    "For evaluation, the models were run on the TIMIT recordings whose formants were measured for the VTR-TIMIT formant database. The output files are generated in a subdirectory /timit/ of the output directory (*checkpoint_dir*). The filename will be prefixed by *checkpoint_dir* and have the suffix \".abs\". These files are text files, with one output line per input spectral envelope in the input file. The columns of the output file consist of the following in order: the filename, 3 placeholder columns (for the particular needs of our research), the time point in milliseconds, 7 more placeholder columns, and then the total number of resonances (poles plus zeros). This is followed by the parameters (frequency, bandwidth, and amplitude correction factor, in that order) of the poles, in order of increasing mean frequency, and then those of the zeros, in order of increasing mean absolute frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other notes:\n",
    "* For output interpretation, it's important to remember that the generated \"amplitudes\" are not actually final formant amplitudes, but rather weighting factors that are used to adjust the initial formant amplitudes generated by formant().\n",
    "* The following code changes the frequencies of the zeros to negative values, to distinguish them from the poles. Also, since the zeros don't have their own amplitude correction factors, a placeholder value of \"0.0\" is inserted (theoretically we should have used 1.0 instead, but this value is not used in any computations).\n",
    "* The output code below assumes a frame rate of once every 5 milliseconds, which is the rate we used for our input data. (However, the VTR TIMIT measurements were taken once every 10 milliseconds, so every other output frame was used for evaluation.)\n",
    "* Since there is nothing in the custom loss code above that distinguishes one formant from another (aside from poles versus zeros), and any of them can take frequency values between 0 and 8000, the model output neurons may generate the formants in any random order (although that order will be constant from one frame to the next; e.g. if neuron 3 generates F1 for one frame, it does so for all frames and files).  The code below reorders the formants by their mean frequencies over all frames.\n",
    "* For the CNN models, each input frame must be converted into a window, and each window fed to the model one at a time in a loop. For the RNN models, the frame sequence can be given to the model all at once because it is designed to read sequences."
