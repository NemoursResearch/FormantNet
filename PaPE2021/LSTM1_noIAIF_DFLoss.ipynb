    "# Code for PaPE2021 non-IAIF models (RNN model with 1 unidirectional LSTM layer, with or without pre-emphasis, with added delta-frequency loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code (run under TensorFlow 2.4) that was used to train and evaluate the non-IAIF models reported to PaPE 2021 is given below. The code is unaltered, except that (1) comments have been added, and (2) code used solely to evaluate the trained model on non-TIMIT data has been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code makes some assumptions based on the circumstances of our computational setup at the time (e.g. file names and locations, etc.) and so cannot be run as-is without the same setup. You may also notice differences in code between the IS2021 models and these models. Some of these differences are due to the necessary differences between the experiments, of course, while other differences are irrelevant to the training and evaluation, and are simply due to the evolution of the code over time, e.g. to make the code more readable and generalizable. We intend to provide a more uniform and user-friendly version of the code for general use soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution:\n",
    "This script was run with five command-line parameters that indicate the number of formants and antiformants; whether spectral smoothing should be done on the linear spectra (\"T\") or the log spectra (\"F\"; we recommend \"T\"); whether to use pre-emphasis or not (\"T\" or \"F\"); and finally the delta-frequency loss weighting parameter W as a percentage. The output (consisting of data statistics, model specifications, and script progress reports, including training and validation loss) is saved to an output file, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM1_noIAIF_DFLoss.py 6 1 T F 10 > LSTM1DF.f6z1TF10.out\n",
    "\n",
    "It needs to be run on a server with access to Tensorflow 2.3 or above. On a GPU it takes us about 4 hours total to run; on a CPU, it may take half a day or more to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "If the name of the directory in which the script is run is e.g. expdir/, then the script looks for the input data in a sister directory ../data/, where the two input file lists timwavs_ordered2.txt and VTRlist1.txt (described below) should be found. Also in there should be a directory ../data/timit/timitlink/, which holds the TIMIT wavefiles in the same directory structure as in the original corpus, i.e. two subdirectories test/ and train/, each with subdirectories for dialects (dr1-dr8), and each of those with subdirectories for each speaker. Unlike the IAIF-using scripts of IS2021, this script takes the original raw wavefiles as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "The output models and evaluation files are saved to a directory named, e.g. expdir/mvt33_f6z1TF10/ (where \"mvt33\" was the unique designation for this experiment, and the rest indicates the command-line options chosen). The model files are stored directly in this directory. A subdirectory, expdir/mvt33_f6z1TF10/timit/, in which the output formant track files are stored, one for each input file. These are stored in a format (described below) that was designed to the specific interests of our laboratory, so scripts will be provided that were used to extract the frequencies for evaluation against the VTR-TIMIT database."

The output files are generated in a subdirectory /timit/ of the output directory (*checkpoint_dir*). The filename will be prefixed by *checkpoint_dir* and have the suffix \".abs\". These files are text files, with one output line for every window of speech extracted from the input file (every 5 msec with the default settings above). The columns of the output file consist of the following in order: the filename, 3 placeholder columns (for the particular needs of our research), the time point in milliseconds, 7 more placeholder columns, and then the total number of resonances (poles plus zeros). This is followed by the parameters (frequency, bandwidth, and amplitude correction factor, in that order) of the poles, in order of increasing mean frequency, and then those of the zeros, in order of increasing mean absolute frequency.\n",

Also, since the zeros don't have their own amplitude correction factors, a placeholder value of \"0.0\" is inserted (theoretically we should have used 1.0 instead, but this value is not used in any computations).\n",

    "* Since there is nothing in the custom loss code above that distinguishes one formant from another (aside from poles versus zeros), and any of them can take frequency values between 0 and 8000, the model output neurons may generate the formants in any random order (although that order will be constant from one frame to the next; e.g. if neuron 3 generates F1 for one frame, it does so for all frames and files).
