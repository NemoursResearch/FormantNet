# FormantNet
Software and data supporting research on formant tracking done at Nemours.

The subdirectory **IS2021** holds files specifically used for the training and evaluation of the models reported by Lilley and Bunnell in the manuscript accepted to InterSpeech 2021.

The subdirectory **PaPE2021** holds similar files, used for the training of the models Lilley and Bunnell reported at the Phonetics and Phonology in Europe (PaPE) 2021 conference. These models are a more advanced version of the IS2021 models, producing better results.

See the README files in each directory for more details. In the interest of having accurate and complete scientific records, those files are completely identical to the ones used for research, except that (1) additional comments have been added, and (2) code used only to evaluate the models on data other than TIMIT data has been removed. Owing to their particular history and evolution, those files are not particularly user-friendly. Soon we intend to place more user-friendly versions of this code in this repository for public use.
