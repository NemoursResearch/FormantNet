# FormantTracking
Software and data supporting research on formant tracking done at Nemours.

The subdirectory **IS2021** holds files specifically used for the training and evaluation of the models reported by Lilley and Bunnell in the manuscript submitted to InterSpeech 2021 (Lilley and Bunnell 2021). See the README file in that directory for more details. In the interest of having accurate and complete scientific records, those files are completely identical to the ones used for research, except that (1) additional comments have been added, and (2) code used only to evaluate the models on data other than TIMIT data has been removed. Owing to their particular history and evolution, those files are not particularly user-friendly. Assuming our IS 2021 paper is accepted for publication, we intend to place more user-friendly versions of that IS2021 code in this repository for public use.
